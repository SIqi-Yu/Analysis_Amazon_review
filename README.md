We've selected an Amazon dataset covering beauty products, apparel, and electronic games. We explore review aspects like "readability," "subjectivity," and "sentiment polarity." Non-textual data is integrated as predictive features. Using sentiment analysis, we predict review utility with a random forest classifier, precisely assessing usefulness and feature importance across three review dimensions. The article innovatively comprehensively analyzes user-generated online reviews, aiming to estimate their helpfulness through sentiment analysis and predictive modeling.
